Air travelers notice a second screening line at airport security checkpoints, called **TSA Pre&#10003;&trade;**.
When entering the terminal, members of the program are treated like humans&mdash;falliable, with good intentions&mdash;instead of as enemy combatants.
Put your bag through the X-ray machine (you can leave your laptop in your bag), then walk through a metal detector (keep your belt and shoes, and avoid the millimeter-wave scanner).
It&rsquo;s essentially the same experience a traveler would have had circa 2000.
[Application to the program][1] requires a nonrefundable $85 background check.
An agent takes fingerprints and identification.
If accepted, the known traveler number is valid for 5 years.

However, TSA Pre&#10003;&trade; seems to have been implemented to assuage complaints about abuses in the normal line.
Since I became a member, I get to avoid the ridiculous belt-laptop-shoes strip show the plebians suffer under.
I have already gotten what I wanted&mdash;a much less invasive security checkpoint&mdash;while the majority of travelers are still trampled upon.
The TSA has removed any incentive to fix their broken system for everyone by placating the minority of frequent travelers.
