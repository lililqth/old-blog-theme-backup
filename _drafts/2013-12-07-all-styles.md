title: If you don't say what you do, you won't get any fans

*With apologies to [Derek Sivers][1], who liked this concept so much he [wrote it twice][2].*

A recruiter asks, "What kind of code do you write?"<br/>
Programmers say, "Java." (Or "functional", or ["blub"][3], or "Objective-C".)

That recruiter then asks, "So what kind of problems do you solve?"<br/>
Programmers say, "Hard problems." (Barely better: "I write programs to suit business needs.")

What does that recruiter do?<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
They might make a vague promise to check out your GitHub.<br/>
Then they walk on, and forget about you!<br/>
Why?<br/>
**You didn't arouse their curiosity!**

What if you'd said, "It's really funky financial ."<br/>
Or&hellip; "This program solves complex field equations."<br/>
Or&hellip; "It's machine-learning social graph traversal."

Any one of these, and you've got their interest.

**Get yourself a magic key phrase that describes what you can do.**
Try out a few different ones, until you see which one always gets the
best reaction from strangers. Use it. Have it ready at a moment's notice.

It doesn't have to narrow what you do at all. Any of those three examples
I use above could sound like anything.

And that's just the point&mdash;**if you have a magic phrase that describes
your code in curious but vague terms, you can make total strangers start
wondering about you.**

But whatever you do, stay away from the words "everything", "nothing",
"all styles", and "totally unique."


**Say something!**
